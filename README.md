If you copy-paste those four files into a repo and push to GitHub, you’ve got a clean, credible SQL project done.

From there:

- We can mirror the structure for the **Zambia payments / mobile money** SQL project.
- Then reuse the CSVs for **two Tableau dashboards** and add those as separate folders or repos.

If you tell me, *“okay, let’s do the payments one next,”* I’ll spit out the full second SQL project in the same plug-and-play way.
